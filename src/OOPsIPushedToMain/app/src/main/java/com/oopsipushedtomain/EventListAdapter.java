/**
 * EventListAdapter is a custom ArrayAdapter designed to bind an ArrayList of Event objects
 * to views for display in a ListView. This adapter is responsible for creating view items
 * for each event in the list, allowing for the display of event titles (or other event properties)
 * within the ListView in EventListActivity.
 * <p>
 * This adapter inflates a custom layout (item_event.xml) for each item in the list, which currently
 * displays the event title. The adapter can be extended to display more detailed information about
 * each event as needed.
 * <p>
 * Outstanding issues:
 * 1. The adapter currently only displays the event title. There may be a need to display more information
 * about each event, such as the event date, location, or a thumbnail image, which would require modifications
 * to both the adapter's getView method and the item_event.xml layout.
